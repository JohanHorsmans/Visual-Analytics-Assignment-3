# Visual-Analytics-Assignment-3

To assess my assignment you should download the .ipynb-script in this repository. This can be done manually by going through the following steps (If you do not wish to run it yourself, the .ipynb-file should be clear and neat to follow either way):

I have named my image "WHTT.jpg". To run my code you need to change either the image name or the path in the code :-)

1: Open the "image_search.ipynb" file in this repository.

2: Press "download" in the top right corner.

3: Save the file as an .ipynb-file (windows: ctrl + s // mac: cmd + s).

4: Upload this to your "src" or "notebooks" folder in Jupyter notebook.

5: Make sure that you have the "WHTT.jpg"-image in your data-folder.

6: Open the script and run it (make sure to run the code from the 'cv101' environment).

__NOTE: The saved images from the assignment can be found in the "images"-folder in this repository.__
